The Predictive Computational Imaging Science & Engineering (PreCISE) group performs research in computational imaging and engineering pursues the advancement in the fields of emerging technologies by use of scalable computational tools and predictive numerical simulations.

Our current projects include:

- Computational inverse problems and imaging
- Uncertainty quantification and predictive computing
- Optimal design of experiments and decision making under uncertainty
- Scientific machine learning for engineering and imaging applications

The PreCISE group is directed by [Dr. Umberto Villa](https://uvilla.github.io) and funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health.
